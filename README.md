# Netflix Data Cleaning and Analysis Project | SQL + Python

## Introduction
This project demonstrates the development of an end-to-end ELT (Extract, Load, Transform) pipeline using SQL and Python. The focus is on cleaning, transforming, and analyzing Netflix data to derive meaningful insights. The project showcases the integration of various data engineering techniques to manage and process large datasets efficiently.

## Project Architecture

The project is structured to facilitate a seamless flow of data from raw ingestion to final analysis. The architecture includes the following stages:

Data Extraction: Raw data is extracted from the source.
Data Loading: The extracted data is loaded into a staging area for further processing.
Data Transformation: Data is cleaned and transformed into a structured format using SQL and Python scripts.
Data Analysis: The transformed data is analyzed to generate insights on Netflix content.

## Technology Stack
Programming Languages: Python, SQL
Data Processing: Pandas, NumPy
Database: SQL-based databases (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL)
Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
Tools: Jupyter Notebook, VS Code, Git

## Dataset Used
Source: Netflix Dataset from Kaggle

## Description: 
The dataset contains information about Netflix movies and TV shows, including titles, cast, director, release year, duration, genre, country, and ratings.

## Project Steps
Data Extraction: Collected raw data from the Netflix dataset.
Data Loading: Loaded data into a SQL database for initial analysis and staging.
Data Cleaning: Applied data cleaning techniques to remove duplicates, handle missing values, and standardize formats.
Data Transformation: Transformed data into a normalized format using SQL queries and Python scripts.
Data Analysis: Conducted exploratory data analysis to uncover trends, patterns, and insights from the cleaned data.
Visualization: Created visual representations of key findings using Python libraries.

## Key Features
Automated ELT Pipeline: A robust pipeline that automates the extraction, loading, and transformation of Netflix data.
Data Quality Assurance: Implementation of data cleaning techniques to ensure high-quality data for analysis.
Optimized SQL Queries: Utilization of advanced SQL queries for efficient data transformation and retrieval.
Comprehensive Analysis: In-depth analysis of Netflix content, including genre distribution, release trends, and rating patterns.

## Results
The project successfully identified key trends in Netflix content, such as popular genres, average ratings by year, and geographical distribution of content. The insights generated can be used for strategic decision-making in content creation and marketing.
